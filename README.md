#QDocker

QDocker is a small qt library to dock a widget object to another 'anchor' widget object.

## Installation

Add qdocker.h and qdocker.cpp to your project and <code>#include "qdocker.h"</code><br>
I also recommend to add the project's license to your source code to  avoid copyright problems. 

## Usage/Examples

## License
LGPL

For commecial use and incompatible open-source licenses I recommend to use the
library only with dynamic linking.
